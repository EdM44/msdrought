Description: Functions for calculating characteristics of a mid-summer drought 
    (MSD), a phenomenon of decreased rainfall during a typical rainy season. 
    The MSD is a feature of rainfall in much of Central America, but is also
    found in other locations, typically those with a Mediterranean climate.
    The details are described in "The Mesoamerican mid-summer drought: the 
    impact of its definition on occurrences and recent changes", HESS, Maurer 
    et al. (2022) '<https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/1425/2022/>'.
