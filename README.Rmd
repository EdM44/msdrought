# MSD

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The MSD R package contains functions for calculating characteristics of a mid-summer drought (MSD), a phenomenon of decreased rainfall during a typical rainy season. The MSD is a feature of rainfall in much of Central America, but is also found in other locations, typically those with a Mediterranean climate. The details are described in "The Mesoamerican mid-summer drought: the impact of its definition on occurrences and recent changes", HESS, Maurer et al. (2022) '<https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/1425/2022/>'.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MSD from [GitHub](https://github.com/Turner-SCU/MSD)

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Turner-SCU/MSD")
```

## Example

These are the steps required to create useful MSD data:

1) Begin with a timeseries or spatraster of precipitation data over time.
2) Filter this data using the msdFilter function.
3) Use the msdDates function to extract relevant dates for the calculations.
4) Supply the msd function with the data from msdDates and select a parameter to calculate.

```{r example}
library(MSD)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
